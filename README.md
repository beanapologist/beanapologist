- 👋 Hi, I’m @beanapologist
- 👀 I’m interested in solving real world challenges by bridging the gaps in our thinking through a combination of classical and quantum physics, number theory, and fractal geometry. I believe there are universal truthes that remain constant across time and space. Time is the conductor by which all actions are based.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Quantum Duality Theory. This theory has the potential to be a Theory of Everything (TOE). I need people who can visualize data and write code to test and model assumptions.
